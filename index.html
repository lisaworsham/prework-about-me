      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently a twitch streamer who plays various games from Red Dead Redemption 2 to Alien: Isolation. I am also a Marketing Coordinator who has lost a passion in her work. Recently, I've decided to take a nosedive into software development due to my passion for videogaming and streaming. So, now, I am currently a student working towards my new career to ultimately be a gaming software developer!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Antonio, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Videogaming, movies, playing with my dog, Valkyrie</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be a gaming software developer and work on one of the Tomb Raider games.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I take pride in making things for other's enjoyment and what better way to make people happy than with a interactive medium?</p>
